| Category | Title & Explanation | Demo Video |
|---|---|---|
| **Agriculture Robotics** | **🤖 SLAMbots: Autonomous Agricultural Fleet 🚜** <br><br> We developed a simulation for a fleet of **SLAM-enabled agricultural robots (Slambots)** to enhance farm supervision through distributed monitoring and autonomous navigation. <br><br>---<br><br>**🌐 Simulation & Web App Focus** <br><br> We simulated fleet behavior in **Webots** 🖥️ with sensor-based data generation. Our focus was to develop a web app for a fleet of Slambots that can: <br> * **Navigate:** Use SLAM for large farmlands 🗺️. <br> * **Distributed Monitoring:** Collect & analyze soil moisture 💧, temperature 🌡️, and crop health 🌱. <br> * **Adaptive Collaboration:** Share data for optimized task distribution 🤝. <br> * **Fail-Safe Operations:** Handle sensor failures 🚫, communication delays ⏳, and power constraints 🔋. <br> * **Remote Supervision:** Enable farmer monitoring via a web/mobile interface 📱. <br><br>---<br><br>**Constraints Handled** 🚧 <br> * **Limited Communication:** Predictive decision-making required 📡. <br> * **Low-Power Optimization:** Minimize energy consumption ⚡. <br> * **Sensor Failures & Redundancy:** Handle dropouts/inaccuracies 📉. <br> * **Localization Without GPS:** Alternative mapping techniques 📍. <br> * **Multi-Robot Coordination:** Optimize fleet-wide task execution 🔄. | <p style="background-color: yellow"> ## Working Prototype: <br> ## Demo Video (Uzhavar's Connect): <br> https://drive.google.com/file/d/13-fs1ZowVl1FC-iuFHti1M-qPBbcU8bn/view?usp=sharing </p> |
| **Smart Farming Assistant** | **Multiple Cropping patterns (Video demo):** <br><br> Develop a smart farming assistant that provides real-time, AI-driven crop management insights, handling multiple cropping pattern simulations. <br><br> **Key Features that we handled:** <br> • Analyze Soil Health & Weather using preloaded Soil Health Card datasets and weather APIs to provide irrigation and sowing suggestions. <br> • AI-based pest and disease detection using sample images. <br> • Fertilizer and pesticide recommendations based on crop type and soil condition. <br> • Simple interface for easy farmer access. | <p style="background-color: yellow"> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ii_-AuKqqPsEYX_1BzR8EIqjyMR7fqTt/view?usp=sharing </p> |
| **Integrated Agricultural System** | **Smart Agricultural Monitoring & Crop Management System using IoT, Computer Vision, YOLO, Deep Learning, Robotics, NLP, Flask, React & Capacitor (Video Demo):** <br><br> • Developed an integrated solution using IoT sensors, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning (YOLO) for real-time crop disease detection, weed identification, and pest monitoring in TN Specific Crops such as Sugarcane, Mango, Coconut & Paddy. <br> • Engineered a multi-terrain robotic system combining land rover, aerial drones for pesticide spraying, and an amphibious hydro vehicle fitted with custom-trained ML models & Sensors for comprehensive field monitoring in Dense, Aquatic & Sparse vegetations. <br> • Implemented automated alarming systems that notify farmers of detected issues through SMS and mobile app notifications, handled through Twilio API. <br> • Created a Multilingual Multimodal conversational AI Chatbot using ElevanLabs & Vapi to assist farmers with crop management decisions, which is accessible in regional languages to improve agricultural knowledge sharing. <br> • Designed a user-friendly dashboard displaying analytical insights, predictive crop health metrics, and recommended interventions. | <p style="background-color: yellow"> https://drive.google.com/file/d/16eeLnnwsqkp_wwrDC6XPq1ZOI1Wf-eMr/view </p> |
| **Rural Education** | To enhance rural education, we add interactive AI enabled smart boards. | <p style="background-color: yellow"> Check the demo video: <br> https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abafd451-3c4e-4647-86fb-741e86a1a053 </p> |
