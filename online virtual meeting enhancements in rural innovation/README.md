We automated & used Jotme.io extension to handle real time translations in text and audio, for online events to remove communication barriers

In the regional translations, it handles only hindi language specific to India.

for it to handle all other indian languages, with regional translations in audio & text, we integrate sarvam ai to reduce
communication barrier as reduced by text transcriptions (live event transcriptions in virtual events- a boom)

live event transcription real time translation 

[eg: india events we used sarvam ai. for multilingual capabilities in regional languages] 

for speech output, we used gTTS model

we can use several other TTS/STT models such as kokoro, whisper, etc.

We also enhanced online note taking using askify extension with which you can parallely run down over the minutes of a meeting virtually (online/hybrid)

and automatically it can take notes (minutes of meeting) from real time virtual gmeets, using audio to text transcriptions when speaker is speaking


We also deployed smart whiteboards, as of now integrating math & physics features using APIs of math opennotes, wolfram alpha, groq

we've the video demo below
