# 🎯 SDG Goals Alignment

This project is designed with a strong commitment to contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our solutions directly address several critical global challenges.

---

## Primary SDG Alignments

Our core functionalities are primarily aligned with these key SDGs:

* **⛳ Goal 2: Zero Hunger**
    * The agricultural monitoring system directly tackles food security by offering **crop health monitoring**, **pest detection**, and **yield optimization**. By addressing poor yields, resource wastage, and financial losses in agriculture, the platform directly works towards achieving food security.

* **⛳ Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being**
    * The Aarogya X medical integration app is engineered to overcome healthcare challenges such as "poor system design leading to errors and low-quality care" and "inadequate coordination for chronically ill patients." It provides essential features like **appointment scheduling**, **medical supply chain management**, and **telemedicine capabilities**.

* **⛳ Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**
    * The platform incorporates **water level monitoring** and **AI-based smart irrigation systems** to combat "inefficient water management" in agriculture. This functionality actively promotes sustainable water use and conservation.

---

## Secondary SDG Alignments

Beyond our primary focus, our project also significantly contributes to the following SDGs:

* **⛳ Goal 1: No Poverty**
    * By enhancing agricultural productivity and minimizing "resource wastage and financial losses," the platform plays a vital role in **increasing farmer incomes and reducing rural poverty**.

* **⛳ Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure**
    * This solution represents a substantial technological leap, leveraging **AI-driven analytics**, **IoT sensors** (future implementation, currently utilizing YOLO-based Deep Learning Models), and **digital platforms** to modernize both agricultural and healthcare infrastructure.

* **⛳ Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities**
    * The platform specifically targets rural communities, offering a **multilingual and multimodal chatbot for agro-based queries** and designed with the needs of rural populations in mind. This helps to **bridge the digital divide** between urban and rural areas.

* **⛳ Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**
    * The agricultural monitoring system advocates for **sustainable farming practices** through precision agriculture, leading to reduced waste via improved resource management and data-driven insights.

* **⛳ Goal 15: Life on Land**
    * The platform supports sustainable land use through features like **soil moisture analysis**, pest management, and crop monitoring, which collectively help **maintain healthy ecosystems** while boosting agricultural productivity.

## Effective path planning graph traversal algorithms for optimization (shortest path, better crop yield, profitable return on investment)

<br/>
<br/>

We actively analysed several graph algorithms and compared them all for better yield in each scenario, ranging from A*, Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, Prims, Kruskal, MST, Bellman Ford, Floyd Warshall, RRT, RRT*, Ford Fulkerson, Flow algorithms

We've prototyped a blockchain based crowdfunding Dapp to facilitate donation of blood, money, clothes, food, tablets, etc. to those who suffer in rural areas out of poverty, we also aim to create employment opportunities, as the system carries potential to deliver remote jobs to the unemployed (eg: delivery work of medicines to a particular location) and by going onchain, you personal confidential data is kept secure & private, with no unauthorized access, we can deploy a federated model with multifactor authentication

competitor analysis performed (literature study): Zepto, dunzo, pharmeasy, swiggy, zomato, ola, uber
<br/>

We simulated a QR based ticketing system for rural people, where in you need to update your personal records, you aadhar details, credit card details, all of it in a single qr, safeguarded by multi factor authentication, biometric securities, federated modelling, and once a person flashes a qr, it proves his collateral guarantees of a property against a personal loan, so immediately queues in receptions could be handled, and ticketing/ reception form filling becomes easier, making it a smarter approach in healthcare

we also deploy scheduling algorithms to handle deadlock, starvation situation, FCFS, SJF, Priority encoding, Page replacement, etc. and we optimize the gantt chart

<br/>

Creating a disaster resilient supply chain, that's capable of handling effective inventory management of medicine stock
<br/>

Bridge the era of digital education, virtual meetings, making a rural city smart, by bridging transmission of messages & real time UDP based firecloud messenger, we deployed many ways to urbanize a rural city, thus trialblazing an attempt to make it smart

<br>

## Innovation

The best innovation that we handled off, is bringing in multilinguality & multimodality, as farmers can't understand all the languages, and to make the services accessible to them too, our opensource system leverages sarvam ai, the most advanced LLM trained for indic languages
