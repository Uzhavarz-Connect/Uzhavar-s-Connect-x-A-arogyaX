# 🎯 SDG Goals Alignment

This project is designed with a strong commitment to contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our solutions directly address several critical global challenges.

---

## Primary SDG Alignments

Our core functionalities are primarily aligned with these key SDGs:

* **⛳ Goal 2: Zero Hunger**
    * The agricultural monitoring system directly tackles food security by offering **crop health monitoring**, **pest detection**, and **yield optimization**. By addressing poor yields, resource wastage, and financial losses in agriculture, the platform directly works towards achieving food security.

* **⛳ Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being**
    * The Aarogya X medical integration app is engineered to overcome healthcare challenges such as "poor system design leading to errors and low-quality care" and "inadequate coordination for chronically ill patients." It provides essential features like **appointment scheduling**, **medical supply chain management**, and **telemedicine capabilities**.

* **⛳ Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**
    * The platform incorporates **water level monitoring** and **AI-based smart irrigation systems** to combat "inefficient water management" in agriculture. This functionality actively promotes sustainable water use and conservation.

---

## Secondary SDG Alignments

Beyond our primary focus, our project also significantly contributes to the following SDGs:

* **⛳ Goal 1: No Poverty**
    * By enhancing agricultural productivity and minimizing "resource wastage and financial losses," the platform plays a vital role in **increasing farmer incomes and reducing rural poverty**.

* **⛳ Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure**
    * This solution represents a substantial technological leap, leveraging **AI-driven analytics**, **IoT sensors** (future implementation, currently utilizing YOLO-based Deep Learning Models), and **digital platforms** to modernize both agricultural and healthcare infrastructure.

* **⛳ Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities**
    * The platform specifically targets rural communities, offering a **multilingual and multimodal chatbot for agro-based queries** and designed with the needs of rural populations in mind. This helps to **bridge the digital divide** between urban and rural areas.

* **⛳ Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**
    * The agricultural monitoring system advocates for **sustainable farming practices** through precision agriculture, leading to reduced waste via improved resource management and data-driven insights.

* **⛳ Goal 15: Life on Land**
    * The platform supports sustainable land use through features like **soil moisture analysis**, pest management, and crop monitoring, which collectively help **maintain healthy ecosystems** while boosting agricultural productivity.

## Effective path planning graph traversal algorithms for optimization (shortest path, better crop yield, profitable return on investment)

<br/>
<br/>

We actively analysed several graph algorithms and compared them all for better yield in each scenario, ranging from A*, Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, Prims, Kruskal, MST, Bellman Ford, Floyd Warshall, RRT, RRT*, Ford Fulkerson, Flow algorithms

<br/>
competitor analysis performed (literature study): Zepto, dunzo, pharmeasy, swiggy, zomato, ola, uber
<br/>

We simulated a QR based ticketing system for rural people, where in you need to update your personal records, you aadhar details, credit card details, all of it in a single qr, safeguarded by multi factor authentication, biometric securities, federated modelling, and once a person flashes a qr, it proves his collateral guarantees of a property against a personal loan, so immediately queues in receptions could be handled, and ticketing/ reception form filling becomes easier, making it a smarter approach in healthcare

we also deploy scheduling algorithms to handle deadlock, starvation situation, FCFS, SJF, Priority encoding, Page replacement, etc. and we optimize the gantt chart

<br/>

Creating a disaster resilient supply chain, that's capable of handling effective inventory management of medicine stock
<br/>

Bridge the era of digital education, virtual meetings, making a rural city smart, by bridging transmission of messages & real time UDP based firecloud messenger, we deployed many ways to urbanize a rural city, thus trialblazing an attempt to make it smart

<br>

## Innovation

The best innovation that we handled off, is bringing in multilinguality & multimodality, as farmers can't understand all the languages, and to make the services accessible to them too, our opensource system leverages sarvam ai, the most advanced LLM trained for indic languages
