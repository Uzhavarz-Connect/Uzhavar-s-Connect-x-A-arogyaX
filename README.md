## 🌐 Simulation & Web App Focus

We simulated fleet behavior in **Webots** 🖥️ with sensor-based data generation. Our focus was to develop a web app for a fleet of Slambots that can:

* **Navigate:** Use SLAM for large farmlands 🗺️.
* **Distributed Monitoring:** Collect & analyze soil moisture 💧, temperature 🌡️, and crop health 🌱.
* **Adaptive Collaboration:** Share data for optimized task distribution 🤝.
* **Fail-Safe Operations:** Handle sensor failures 🚫, communication delays ⏳, and power constraints 🔋.
* **Remote Supervision:** Enable farmer monitoring via a web/mobile interface 📱.

---

## Constraints Handled 🚧

* **Limited Communication:** Predictive decision-making required 📡.
* **Low-Power Optimization:** Minimize energy consumption ⚡.
* **Sensor Failures & Redundancy:** Handle dropouts/inaccuracies 📉.
* **Localization Without GPS:** Alternative mapping techniques 📍.
* **Multi-Robot Coordination:** Optimize fleet-wide task execution 🔄.

weather APIs to provide irrigation and sowing suggestions. 
• AI-based pest and disease detection using sample images. 
• Fertilizer and pesticide recommendations based on crop type and soil 
condition. 
• Simple interface for easy farmer access. 


 ## Smart Agricultural Monitoring & Crop Management System using IoT, Computer Vision, YOLO, Deep Learning, Robotics, NLP, Flask, React & Capacitor (Video Demo):

 
 
– Developed an integrated solution using IoT sensors, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning (YOLO) for
 real-time crop disease detection, weed identification, and pest monitoring in TN Specific Crops such as
 Sugarcane, Mango, Coconut & Paddy.
– Engineered a multi-terrain robotic system combining land rover, aerial drones for pesticide spraying, and
 an amphibious hydro vehicle fitted with custom-trained ML models & Sensors for comprehensive field
 monitoring in Dense, Aquatic & Sparse vegetations
– Implemented automated alarming systems that notify farmers of detected issues through SMS and mobile app
 notifications, handled through Twilio API
– Created a Multilingual Multimodal conversational AI Chatbot using ElevanLabs & Vapi to assist
 farmers with crop management decisions, which is accessible in regional languages to improve agricultural
 knowledge sharing
– Designed a user-friendly dashboard displaying analytical insights, predictive crop health metrics, and
recommended interventions.




To enhance rural education, we add interactive AI enabled smart boards
