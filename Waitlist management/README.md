We deployed priority scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, SJF, Priority scheduling, shortest booking time first, round robin, page replacement algorithms and optimize the results for giving priority to higher officials, VIP crowd, generic users etc.

we also provide them with shortest path to the event venues deploying gmaps & places API

we deal with shortest path graph traversalm algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra, RRT, RRT*, BFS, DFS, KRUSKAL, MST, PRIMS, BELLMAN FORD, FLOYD WARSHALL, FORD FULKERSON, Page algorithms


waitlist mngmt simply means waitlist prioiritization based on attendance percentage (regular event attendee), engagement lvls (past event participation, no. of events hosted, interactions carried out with the platform, which leads to incentivization of rewards), behavior data-> vip status, loyalty for these ppl we provide First preferences, for others w/o predictions (FCFS) & with automation (using ai prediction)- swapping b/w confirmation list and waiting list
